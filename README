= Prime Challenge

=== DESCRIPTION

Prints a multiplication table with consecutive primes as the operands. This is done using a generalized ComputedTable class that can take any enumerable inputs and compute their combination using a provided block.

To use, run

    ruby ./prime_challenge.rb

Can be run with an optional integer argument to change the size of the prime lists used to generate the table. Default is 10.
